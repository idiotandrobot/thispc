Modify Windows 8.1 Explorer This PC contents

Windows 8.1 renamed Windows Explorer's Computer to This PC and added access to user Documents, Downloads, Music, Pictures and Videos folders.

This project provides a simple UI to remove (or re-add) these folders.

NB. The program modifies Local Machine in the registry so Visual Studio and the compiled exe need to be run As Administrator to function correctly.
